### Understanding Market Basket Analysis
Market basket analysis is a data mining technique retailers use to increase sales by better understanding customer purchasing patterns. It involves analyzing large data sets, such as purchase history, to reveal product groupings and products likely to be purchased together. This application of data science in marketing plays a pivotal role in enhancing company revenues and fostering business expansion. Here is the [dataset](https://github.com/TheDamiofLagos/FLiT-Data-Science-Mentorship-Projects/blob/main/Project%201%20-%20Market%20Basket%20Analysis/Market%20Basket%20Analysis%20-%20Groceries_dataset.csv) used in this project created by FLIT.

## Tools <a name="tools"></a>
* Data Analysis Tools: Python (using libraries like Pandas and Numpy)
* Data Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn
 
## Project Objective
This project is one of the FLIT Data Science Projects of the Apprenticeship Program. FLiT is an initiative of Utiva in partnership with the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the Challenge Fund for Youth Employment (CFYE) program.
#
The objective of this project is to familiarise you with market basket analysis, a vital component of data science in retail and e-commerce.
This project will help sales and marketing teams understand customer behavior and develop more effective product placement, pricing, cross-sell, and up-sell tactics for business optimization. To do this, we will do the following:
* Create a Jupyter Notebook for data analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib.
* Identify items frequently purchased together.
* Give recommendations based on the findings.
* Explore some visualization techniques.

### Implementing the task in Python
- Step 1: Importing all necessary libraries
- Step 2: Loading and exploring the data
- Step 3: Converting the data into a suitable format for analysis
- Step 4: Applying Apriori Algorithm
- Step 5: Creating visual representations of the data to gain deeper insights

Here is the Jupyter notebook showcasing the project, entirely implemented in Python.
