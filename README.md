# Understanding Market Basket Analysis
Market basket analysis is a data mining technique retailers use to increase sales by better understanding customer purchasing patterns. It involves analyzing large data sets, such as purchase history, to reveal product groupings and products likely to be purchased together.
# Tools
. Data Analysis Tools:Python(using libraries like Pandas,Numpy)
. Data Visualization Tools:Matplotlib, Seaborn
. Sklearn
# Project Objective
The objective of this project is to familiarise you with market basket analysis a vital component of data science in retail and e-commerce.
This project will help sales and marketing teams understand customers behaviour, develop more effective product placement, pricing, cross-sell, and up-sell tactics for business optimization.
To do this we will do the following:
. Create a Jupyter Notebook for data analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib.
. Identify items frequently purchased together.
. Give recommendations based on the findings.
. Explore some visualization techniques.
